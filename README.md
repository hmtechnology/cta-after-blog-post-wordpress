## Description
This WordPress function provides a simple and effective way to add a Call to Action (CTA) section after a blog post. You can use it to promote a specific page or action to your readers by displaying a well-designed CTA container with a title, description, and a prominent button.

## Usage

1. Copy the code from the `functions.php` file provided in this repository.
2. Paste the code into your theme's `functions.php` file or a custom plugin file.

**Note:** This code is set up to insert the CTA only in the "post" post type. 

## Customizing the CTA

You can easily customize the CTA by editing the HTML and CSS within the function. The default CTA includes a title, description, and a button, but you can modify these elements to fit your specific needs. The styling of the CTA is also customizable to match your site's design.

Feel free to adjust the content and styling within the function to create a CTA that suits your goals and branding.
